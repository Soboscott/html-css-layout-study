Submit a pull request with responses to the following questions

What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between
 them.

```md
one would use the format functions of width, margin, padding & border;
the other uses box-sizing with border-box
```

In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute
 positioning.

```md
absolute positioning stays in a "fixed" position within it's parent element.
relative acts like static, but the element can be positioned in different places
```

What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common
 mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.

```md
1-using floats and not clearing them.
2-no knowing the floated element should be placed BEFORE the content they floted over
3-not understanding how z-indexing and absolute positioning can effect the layout.
```
